## About me

My name is Kyle Parrent and Iâ€™m a full stack software developer. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed building projects ever since I was little. Whether it be Legos, models, woodworking, or apps. I am constantly looking for new ways to improve to knowledge and new tools to use when building applications.
